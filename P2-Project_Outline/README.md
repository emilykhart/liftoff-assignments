## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Our symptom tracker is an application to help those who have anything from chronic health issues, mental health issues, or just trying to understand their body better. As a user you will be able to create a user profile and a secure login. From there, you will be able to add a custom symptom that you want to track for your own health. These will be saved to your profile to retrieve on daily or weekly basis whatever the user would like their logging to look like. As the user logs their symptoms, it would be saved into a database to be used in their dashboard charts. Their charts would display one or all of their symptoms depending on their choice on their dropdown and then they could see graphically overtime their symptom. Ultimately, it should help the user figure out any trends in their health to help them better understand themselves.
### Features
1. Create Account -- users will be able to create a unique account or be able to use Single Sign On.
2. Secure Login -- authentication using bcrypt in order to protect the users
3. Profile Edit/Update -- Users will be able to change their password, email, and any other important health information they would like to provide. 
4. Database using SQL for Customer Data -- using object relational mapping and persistent data 
5. Custom Symptoms -- each user will be able to add a custom symptom that they would want to track themselves so they aren't boxed into a certain one we create. 
6. Log Symptom Feature -- the user will be able to log their symptom, what they are feeling that day with a little blog post, and possibly potential factors that could effect that symptom. Such as high anxiety with a factor of low sleep.
7. Chart / Graphs of their symptoms -- either using an API or a library within JavaScript, the user will see all of their data for each symptom on the days that they have logged. 
8. Dashboard for Users -- a user will be able to see a certain range of symptoms. Filters can be date range, specific set of symptoms, etc.
9. Friendly for Mobile Users - utilizing CSS and HTML we can make the application reactive to whatever screen that they are viewing it on: ipad, phone, laptop. 
10. Daily Reminders -- setting up automated reminders for the users to log their symptoms sent via text message. 
### Technologies
Java and MySQL for backend, JavaScript and Angular for frontend 
### What I'll Have to Learn
What we will have to learn is a broader sense of what Angular can do and how we can use it to our benefit. We will also need to learn how to effectively implement either an API or a JS library for our visualization of our data. Also, making sure our database is using the data a user submits correctly.
